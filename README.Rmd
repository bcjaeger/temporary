# temporary

this is a project I am working on with Devin to introduce the `drake`, `dflow`, and `usethis` packages. 

## instructions

1. Open rstudio and apply the `usethis` package to create this project from github.
1. Use the `usethis` package to create a separate project that you can call 'devin-temp'
1. Use the `dflow` package to create a drake focused project.
1. Write a fake plan with some semblance to the plan in this repo.
1. use the `usethis` package to publish the repository on github. 
1. let me know when you are done and we can set up a time to review and go through questions.

# temporary

this is a project I am working on with Devin to introduce the `drake`,
`dflow`, and `usethis` packages.

## instructions

1.  Open rstudio and apply the `usethis` package to create this project
    from github.
2.  Use the `usethis` package to create a separate project that you can
    call ‘devin-temp’
3.  Use the `dflow` package to create a drake focused project.
4.  Write a fake plan with some semblance to the plan in this repo.
5.  use the `usethis` package to publish the repository on github.
6.  let me know when you are done and we can set up a time to review and
    go through questions.
